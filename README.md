How to set up, configure, and work with git and GitHub.

## What is `git`?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. ^[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. It currently hosts work by approximately 100M developers.^[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)
