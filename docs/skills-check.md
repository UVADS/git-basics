## Novice

1. Create a `git` repository in GitHub.
2. Create a `git` repository using the command-line.
3. Set up SSH key authentication to GitHub
4. Clone a GitHub repository to your local computer.
5. Perform simple `git add` / `commit` / `push` / `pull` operations.
6. Display `git` status at any time in your repository.

## Advanced Beginner

1. List the branches in your local repository.
2. Create and switch to a new branch in your local repository.
3. Make changes then add/commit/push the new branch back to GitHub.
4. Merge a branch into `main`.
5. Delete a local branch.
6. Display the `git log` for your repository.

## Competent

1. Fork a repository that you do not own.
2. Clone the fork you just created.
3. Configure an `upstream` remote so that you can synchronize your fork with any changes in the original repo.
4. Fetch and merge from `upstream`.
5. Be familiar with how to smooth out a simple (1 file) MERGE conflict.

## Expert

1. Create a `git alias` by editing `~/.gitconfig`
2. Set up a GitHub Action to automatically build or test your software.
3. Customize this Action so that it only runs on a specific branch, or only if it contains a tag.
