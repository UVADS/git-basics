# GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues is a robust and collaborative issue tracking system that helps teams manage and prioritize tasks, bugs, and feature requests within a GitHub repository. Users can create issues to report problems, suggest enhancements, or outline new features. Each issue acts as a centralized hub for discussions, allowing team members to comment, share insights, and collaborate on problem-solving. Additionally, issues can be assigned to specific team members, labeled for categorization, and linked to pull requests, fostering a seamless integration with the overall development workflow.

Each repository in GitHub comes with an Issues page by default:

![GitHub Issues](https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-activity/guidelines/images/issue-list.png)

In the example above, note a few details:

- There are 16 open issues and 2 closed.
- Each issue is assigned a unique number.
- Each issue can be tagged (i.e. bug, question, enhancement, etc.) Tags can be customized.
- Each issue becomes a thread for comments and  automated processes (if desired). Issues can be scoped to specific files or even lines of code.
- Issues can be assigned to team members for tracking.

GitHub Issues provides a structured and transparent way for teams to organize their work, enabling efficient project management. It offers features such as customizable labels, milestones, and project boards to help teams track progress, set priorities, and ensure that all relevant stakeholders are informed about the status and resolution of each issue. This collaborative and integrated approach enhances communication and facilitates a smooth development process by keeping everyone aligned on the project's goals and tasks.
